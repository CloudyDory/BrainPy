    "BrainPy is built on Jax and can accelerate model running performance based on [Just-in-Time(JIT) compilation](./compilation.ipynb). In order to enhance performance on CPU and GPU, we publish another package ``BrainPyLib`` to provide several built-in low-level operators in synaptic computation. These operators are written in C++/CUDA and wrapped as Jax primitives by using ``XLA``. However, users cannot simply customize their own operators unless they have specific background. To solve this problem, we introduce `numba.cfunc` here and provide convenient interfaces for users to customize operators without touching the underlying logic. In this tutorial, we will introduce how to customize operators on CPU. Please notice that BrainPy currently only supports CPU operators customization, and GPU operators will be supported in the future."

    "It is not easy to write a C++/CUDA operator and implement a series of conversion. Users have to learn how to write a C++/CUDA operator, how to write a customized Jax primitive, and how to convert your C++/CUDA operator into a Jax primitive. Here are some links for users who prefer to dive into the details: [Jax primitives](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/How_JAX_primitives_work.html), [XLA custom calls](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/custom_call).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can only provide limit amounts of operators for users, and it would be great if users can customize their own operators in a relatively simple way. To achieve this goal, BrainPy provides a convenient interface `XLACustomOp` to register customized operators on CPU. Users no longer need to involve any C++ programming and XLA compilation. This is accomplished with the help of [`numba.cfunc`](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/cfunc.html), which will wrap python code as a compiled function callable from foreign C code. The C function object exposes the address of the compiled C callback so that it can be passed into XLA and registered as a jittable Jax primitives. Here is an example of using `XLACustomOp` on CPU."
